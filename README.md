# Shorten the dropdown of compilers on gcc.godbolt.org

Simple CSS script that will leave only clang (trunk), gcc (snapshot) and CL 2017 in the dropdown list on [godbolt](https://gcc.godbolt.org/).

To use, import this in the "Stylish" extension in Chrome/Firefox (I guess, didn't try it myself).

I rarely use other compilers, so this is tailored for me. In case another compiler is needed, either disable Stylish, or blindly type a substring of its name and hit `Down`|`Enter`.

I don't know CSS, so patches are welcome if needed.
